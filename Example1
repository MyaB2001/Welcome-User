Yes, I have something I would like to say.

So I can understand that some of you have been having some questions about certain rules on the server, but if you are unsure about a certain rule then just keep the MOTD pulled up in your browser from time-to-time because everyone isn't expected to remember the rules to their entirety. If you're using Google Chrome then you can also press Ctrl and F to use the page search, which is relatively easier.

Putting that aside, I really want to thank you all for your performances on the server because it was amazing how some of you were able to join the server whenever the players needed help. In advance, I just want to point out a few that have been keeping the server in order, and those few are Yoda, Dungeon, Robin, Vegetable Man, and Franky,
